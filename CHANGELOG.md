## [0.1.0] — 2025-01-XX

Baseline release after merging the terminal-demo, real-terminal-wiring,
and terminal-improvements branches.

### Added
- Mock terminal mode for development without GDExtension.
- `godotty-node` addon scaffolding with `build_extension.sh` helper.
- Real `TerminalNode2D` PTY backend wiring.
- Robust ANSI SGR parser:
  - Combined codes (`\x1b[1;32m`).
  - 256-color (`\x1b[38;5;Nm`).
  - Truecolor (`\x1b[38;2;R;G;Bm`).
  - OSC sequences (titles, hyperlinks).
  - Partial-escape buffering across PTY read chunks.
- Solarized Dark color palette.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+L (clear), Ctrl+D (EOF).
- Command history (↑ / ↓).
- Viewport resize → terminal cols/rows propagation.

### Fixed
- `write_input` now appends `\n` so commands actually execute in the PTY.
- Ctrl+C now sends real `\x03` (SIGINT) instead of just printing `^C`.
- Focus-grab loop (RichTextLabel + ScrollContainer were stealing focus from LineEdit).
- Windows: force mock mode; portable_pty DLL init was failing.
- Removed `class_name TerminalManager` (collided with autoload of same name).
